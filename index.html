    I current work at a place called
    <a href="http://www.sewellelectronics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sewell Industrial Electronics</a>
    and its a horrible fucking place. I get paid very little compaired to most
    jobs in my field. I know plenty of people make far less than I do and they
    too deserve to get paid more, but that is a completely different horse to
    kick. The work isn't particularly hard, just the work is done or the tools
    we are expected to use make things so much more difficult. Oh, and safety,
    ha! What fucking safety? Just like we are provided make things more
    difficult, tools that are too old, too worn or just plain wrong makes the
    job unsafe. <br /><strong>It's time for a change</strong>!
